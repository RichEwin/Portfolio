## End of week evaluation 

**Did you meet all of your goals?**

This week has been tough. I have been intoduced to how the web works and it is a lot of information to consolidate in addition to various subjects from week one and two that I am still trying to understand. I have found that creating my own definition sheets allows me to write up explanations of each topic in a way I can underatand. 

I have noticed that strict planning is helping me achieve my goals, it allows me to break topics down into manageable pieces to learn. I have started to plan for each day the night before, which allows me to have a clear guide to the days goals.

**What would you change/improve moving forward?**
