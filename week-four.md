## Week Four Goals

- Build a simple web app with a database
- Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

**Plans to achieve**

- Attend the domain modelling workshop
- Learn SQL to build databases
- Build a web app that stores web bookmarks in a database

**Daily Goals**
