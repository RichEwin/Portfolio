## Week Four Goals

- Build a simple web app with a database
- Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

**Plans to achieve**

- Attend the domain modelling workshop
- Learn SQL to build databases
- Build a web app that stores web bookmarks in a database

**Daily Goals**


- GOAL: Review week three’s curriculum and identify areas that I am lacking knowledge. Create a plan of how I am going to skill up in these areas.
- PLAN: Walk through week three’s [Technical Learning Resource](https://airtable.com/shrlqxQm2BeUDvFyp/tblokmw6yNUO75ge6) and document areas of improvement by completing relevant practices.
- EVIDENCE: Examples of exercises. 

Tuesday
