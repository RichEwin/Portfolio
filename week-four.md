## Week Four Goals

- Build a simple web app with a database
- Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

**Plans to achieve**

- Attend the domain modelling workshop
- Learn SQL to build databases
- Build a web app that stores web bookmarks in a database

**Daily Goals**


- GOAL: Review week three’s curriculum and identify areas that I am lacking knowledge. Create a plan of how I am going to skill up in these areas.
- PLAN: Walk through week three’s [Technical Learning Resource](https://airtable.com/shrlqxQm2BeUDvFyp/tblokmw6yNUO75ge6) and document areas of improvement by completing relevant practices.
- EVIDENCE: Examples of exercises. 

Tuesday

- GOAL: Learn SQL
- PLAN: Work through [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)
- EVIDENCE: I have created a [SQL Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C45ZA963HKtWw9t3UZTkjzoqbYf_Axs-O0wPFi36dpM/edit#gid=0) that records all relevant syntax. This sheet helped me when pair programming on creating a bookmark manager web application.

Wednesday

- GOAL: Continue my learning on SQL and Databases.
- PLAN: Work through [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)
- EVIDENCE: I have created a [SQL Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C45ZA963HKtWw9t3UZTkjzoqbYf_Axs-O0wPFi36dpM/edit#gid=0) that records all relevant syntax. This sheet helped me when pair programming on creating a bookmark manager web application.


Thursday

- GOAL: Build a Daily Diary Application.
- PLAN: Use week three and four learnings to build a web application that is built using a web framework, database and written using three languages: Ruby, SQL and HTML.
- EVIDENCE: Link to github repo with DDA

Friday

- GOAL: Continue to build my Daily Diary Application and start the weekend challenge: a clone of Twitter.
- PLAN: Use week three and four learnings to build a web application that is built using a web framework, database and written using three languages: Ruby, SQL and HTML.
- EVIDENCE: [Here](https://github.com/RichEwin/daily_diary) is a link to my diary application and my Twitter clone, [Chitter](https://github.com/RichEwin/chitter-challenge) . 

## End of week evaluation 

**Did you meet all of your goals?**

Yes, this week I built two web applications using a database, PostgreSQL. I have also learnt a new language called SQL which has allowed me to manipulate data from my database to my application.

**What would you change/improve moving forward?**

Planning, Planning, Planning! I need to spend more time planning the structure of my application before rushing into the build. Things like sequence diagrams, domain modelling and CRC cards are helping, but I am also exploring other options which will help me model a domain.
