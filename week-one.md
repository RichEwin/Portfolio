## Week One Goals

- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
- Pair using the driver-navigator style
- Follow an effective debugging process
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

**Plans to achieve**

- Attend workshops on debugging and TDD.
- Work through a weekly challenge using objects and methods collaboratively whilst adopting TDD.
- Work through a weekend challenge using objects and methods within a TDD environment.
- Pair daily on various challenges and ask my pairing partner for feedback at the end of each session.
- Debug two Ruby programs which will include multiple syntax and testing errors.
- Research and understand encapsulation and SRP. Then use these principles in my programs.

**Daily Goals**

Tuesday

- GOAL: Understand how to debug something.
- PLAN: Attend debugging workshop and work through debugging exercises solo. 
- EVIDENCE: I debugged a program I created called [Airport](https://github.com/RichEwin/airport_challenge/blob/master/README.md).

Wednesday

- GOAL: Obtain a better understanding of TDD.
- PLAN: Attend the TDD workshop, research best practices and understand the syntax and methods used to create tests.
- EVIDENCE: I created a Rspec [cheat sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zsVk9zPtIPW3z2oflgRTZxd1yyj0J9xrX4FOJTZFjcE/edit?usp=sharing) containing useful syntax and past tests. I will continue to add to this throughout my time at Makers. I also completed two TDD exercises:  [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/RichEwin/boris-bikes), [Dice_App](https://github.com/RichEwin/dice_app/tree/master/dice_app) and [Airport](https://github.com/RichEwin/airport_challenge/blob/master/README.md).

Thursday

- GOAL: Become better at pair programming. 
- PLAN: Ask my partners to provide feedback after each pairing session. 
- EVIDENCE: I created a pairing feedback [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQjoODGiYxHYQXUGKW5nu0hJ60rz-I1ecmDDLahi_IFkNm9Q/viewform) to send to my pairing partners. I will review the results weekly and identify areas of growth.

Friday

- GOAL: Research and explain via rubber-ducking the basic OO principles.
- PLAN: Use encapsulation and single-responsibility principal when completing two Ruby programs: [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/RichEwin/boris-bikes) and [Airport](https://github.com/RichEwin/airport_challenge/blob/master/README.md).
- EVIDENCE: Ask a coach to review my Airport challenge and receive feedback on how/if I used encapsulation and single-responsibility principal.

## End of week evaluation 

**Did you meet all of your goals?**

I need to spend time over the weekend to work through various debugging exercises. I debugged various programs this week but would like to spend more time improving this skill.

**What would you change/improve moving forward?**

The feedback I received from my pairing partners this week is to become more confident when writing unit tests and explain my thought process when driving. I feel these comments are fair and I will work on this over the next few weeks.
