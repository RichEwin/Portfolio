## Week One Goals

- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
- Pair using the driver-navigator style
- Follow an effective debugging process
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

**Plans to achieve**

- Attend workshops on debugging and TDD.
- Work through a weekly challenge using objects and methods (Boris Bikes) collaboratively whilst adopting TDD.
- Work through a weekend challenge (Airport) using objects and methods within a TDD environment.
- Pair daily on various challenges and ask my pairing partner for feedback at the end of each session.
- Debug two Ruby programs (Boris Bikes and Airport) which will include multiple syntax and testing errors.
- Research and understand encapsulation and SRP. Then use these principles in my programs (Boris Bikes and Airport).

**Daily Goals**

Tuesday

Thursday

- GOAL: Become better at pair programming. 
- PLAN: Ask my partners to provide feedback after each pairing session. 
- EVIDENCE: I created a pairing feedback [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQjoODGiYxHYQXUGKW5nu0hJ60rz-I1ecmDDLahi_IFkNm9Q/viewform) to send to my pairing partners. I will review the results weekly and identify areas of growth.

Friday

- GOAL: Research and explain basic OO principles.
- PLAN: Use encapsulation and single-responsibility principal when completing two Ruby programs (Boris Bikes and Airport).
