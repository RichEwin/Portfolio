## Week One Goals

- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
- Pair using the driver-navigator style
- Follow an effective debugging process
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

**Plans to achieve**

- Attend workshops on debugging and TDD.
- Work through a weekly challenge using objects and methods (Boris Bikes) collaboratively whilst adopting TDD.
- Work through a weekend challenge (Airport) using objects and methods within a TDD environment.
- Pair daily on various challanges and ask my pairing partner for feedback at the end of each session.
- Debug 2 Ruby programs (Boris Bikes and Airport) which will include multiple syntax and testing errors.
- Research and understand encapsulation and SRP. Then use these principles in my programs (Boris Bikes and Airport).
