## Week Six Goals

- Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- Give and receive meaningful code review

**Plans to achieve**

- Work in a team to build a clone of AirBnB
- Write and Test meaningful code throughout the week that contributes to the project
- Contribute to all daily stand ups to help move the project forward

**Daily Goals**

Monday - Friday

- GOAL: Work in a team and build a clone if AirBnB, building to a specification, than the strucutred challenge
- PLAN: 

- Listen and consider my teammate's ideas when building this project and consolidate any feedback they provide to me when working together.
- Contribute to all daily stand ups to help move the project forward
- Write and Test meaningful code throughout the week that contributes to the project

- EVIDENCE: Here is the [AirBnB](https://github.com/RichEwin/Makers_BnB) we built as a team of four. More information can be found in the project README.

## End of week evaluation 

Week six has been my favorite week. I really enjoyed working in a team to build an application when only given a basic specification. 

**Did you meet all of your goals?**

Yes, as a team we completed our first MVP on Tuesday and our second MVP on Thursday.

**What would you change/improve moving forward?**

As a team we decided to consolidate our learnings from the last 6 weeks and build our application in Ruby, Sinatra, CSS and HTML with full feature and unit testing (Rspec & Capybara). I would had liked to have used Javascript and Jquery, however will use these technoligues for another project.
