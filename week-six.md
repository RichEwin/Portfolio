## End of week evaluation 

Week six has been my favorite week. I really enjoyed working in a team to build an application when only given a basic specification. 

**Did you meet all of your goals?**

Yes, as a team we completed our first MVP on Tuesday and our second MVP on Thursday.

**What would you change/improve moving forward?**

As a team we decided to consolidate our learnings from the last 6 weeks and build our application in Ruby, Sinatra, CSS and HTML with full feature and unit testing (Rspec & Capybara). I would had liked to have used Javascript and Jquery, however will use these technoligues for another project.
