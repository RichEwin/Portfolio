## Week Two Goals

- Use all of week one's skills 
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
- Attend my first process workshop


**Plans to achieve**

- Attend workshops on domain modelling and code review.
- Work through a weekly challenge using objects and methods collaboratively whilst adopting TDD.
- Work through a weekend challenge using objects and methods within a TDD environment.
- Research and understand Encapsulation, SRP, Coupling, Cohesion, and Public & Private Methods.
- Pair daily on various challenges and ask my pairing partner for feedback at the end of each session.

**Daily Goals**

Monday

- GOAL: Review another persons code and give them meaningful feedback. Understand what approaches can be used when reviewing code. 
- PLAN:  When reviewing code use three approaches to deliver the feedback: 

- Appreciate(for example: a clear name, something easy to understand, or a good test case)
- Suggest(suggest at least one thing that might improve the code. Try to give a reason why your suggestion would be an improvement
- Respond(respond to the code and illustrate your answers using code snippets and links to relevant resources which could help improve)

- EVIDENCE: I reviewed a peers code via a [pull request](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge/pull/1809) and provided relevant feedback. I enjoyed this exercise as it allowed me to understand how other devs approach the same problem. 

Tuesday

- GOAL: Understand Encapsulation, Single Responsibility Principal, Coupling, Cohesion, and Public & Private Methods.
- PLAN: Use various sources of information to guide me as well as completing various challenges set by Makers.
- EVIDENCE: I have created a [Definitions Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z74SrdndxfJ929KgbYR3Vx4SVe0gjS1KBG1_yDnJPLE/edit) that I will ask my peers and a coach to review to confirm my understanding of each concept.

Wednesday

- GOAL: Identify ways to plan and structure my approach to challenges. When completing the weekend challenge, I jumped straight in which resulted in me hitting blockers and needing to re-evaluate my strategy.
- PLAN: Attend the domain modelling workshop and work through relevant exercises. Break down new problems by splitting the user stories into an Objects, Variables, and Messages table.
- EVIDENCE: Completed the [Calculate](https://github.com/RichEwin/calculate/tree/master) exercise.

Thursday

- GOAL: Start completing live code challenges to get comfortable with coding under pressure.
- PLAN: Attend a process workshop and record my session.
- EVIDENCE: [Recorded Session]

Friday

- GOAL: Continue to understand unit testing by completing two exercises and sharing my code with coaches for feedback.
- PLAN: Research and implement unit testing by using a variety of materials. 
- EVIDENCE: Completed the Bank_Account and Takeaway exercises.

## End of week evaluation 

**Did you meet all of your goals?**

A goal of mine last week was to become better at pair programming and have a clearer understanding of the driver and navigator concept. I received excellent feedback from my peers, which has allowed me to become more confident when pairing. 

```
You were excellent at linking the code we were writing to OOP principles. You took time thinking about the design of the code and I could see you thinking ahead which is always good.
```

```
Clear and concise in describing what you were doing or thinking
```

```
Went at a good pace, stopped me if I wasn't clear on something, broke down the task and followed the instructions well
```

```
Great navigator - gave me lots of space to figure things out before jumping in.
```

```
Talked through code well and talked through expectations of test really well. Made it easy to understand what you were trying to get to.
```

**What would you change/improve moving forward?**

I am not 100% confident writing unit tests and fully understanding Rspec. At the moment I am putting tests together to make my code pass but I want to be confident in the tests I write and understand why I am using a particular piece of syntax. I understand the concept of unit testing and embrace it, however I feel like I can't justify exactly why I am writing a particular test. 

I am going to work on more testing exercises, ask coaches for feedback on the programs I create and speak to my peer group about how they have learnt to unit test.
