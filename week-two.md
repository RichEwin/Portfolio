## Week Two Goals

- Use all of week one's skills 
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
- Attend my first process workshop


**Plans to achieve**

- Attend workshops on domain modelling and code review.
- Work through a weekly challenge using objects and methods collaboratively whilst adopting TDD.
- Work through a weekend challenge using objects and methods within a TDD environment.
- Research and understand Encapsulation, SRP, Coupling, Cohesion, and Public & Private Methods.
- Pair daily on various challenges and ask my pairing partner for feedback at the end of each session.

**Daily Goals**

Monday

- GOAL: Review another persons code and give them meaningful feedback. Understand what approaches can be used when reviewing code. 
- PLAN:  When reviewing code use three approaches to deliver the feedback: 

- Appreciate(for example: a clear name, something easy to understand, or a good test case)
- Suggest(suggest at least one thing that might improve the code. Try to give a reason why your suggestion would be an improvement
- Respond(respond to the code and illustrate your answers using code snippets and links to relevant resources which could help improve)

- EVIDENCE: I reviewed a peers code via a [pull request](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge/pull/1809) and provided relevant feedback. I enjoyed this exercise as it allowed me to understand how other devs approach the same problem. 

Tuesday

- GOAL: Understand Encapsulation, Single Responsibility Principal, Coupling, Cohesion, and Public & Private Methods.
- PLAN: Use various sources of information to guide me as well as completing various challenges set by Makers.
- EVIDENCE: I have created a [Definitions Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z74SrdndxfJ929KgbYR3Vx4SVe0gjS1KBG1_yDnJPLE/edit) that I will ask my peers and a coach to review to confirm my understanding of each concept.

Wednesday

- GOAL: Identify ways to plan and structure my approach to challenges. When completing the weekend challenge, I jumped straight in which resulted in me hitting blockers and needing to re-evaluate my strategy.
- PLAN: Attend the domain modelling workshop and work through relevant exercises. Break down new problems by splitting the user stories into an Objects, Variables, and Messages table.
- EVIDENCE: Completed the [Calculate](https://github.com/RichEwin/calculate/tree/master) exercise.

Thursday

- GOAL: Start completing live code challenges to get comfortable with coding under pressure.
- PLAN: Attend a process workshop and record my session.
- EVIDENCE: [Recorded Session]

Friday

- GOAL: 
- PLAN: 
- EVIDENCE: 

## End of week evaluation 

**Did you meet all of your goals?**

A goal of mine last week was to become better at pair programming and have a clearer understanding of the driver and navigator concept. I received excellent feedback from my peers, which has allowed me to become more confident when pairing. 

```
You were excellent at linking the code we were writing to OOP principles. You took time thinking about the design of the code and I could see you thinking ahead which is always good.

Clear and concise in describing what you were doing or thinking

Went at a good pace, stopped me if I wasn't clear on something, broke down the task and followed the instructions well

Great navigator - gave me lots of space to figure things out before jumping in.

Talked through code well and talked through expectations of test really well. Made it easy to understand what you were trying to get to.
```

**What would you change/improve moving forward?**
