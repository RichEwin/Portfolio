## End of week evaluation 

**Did you meet all of your goals?**

I have found it difficult to understand callbacks and other basic functionality within javascript. I think this is natural as it is a brand new language and will take time to understand fully. I am going to spend time on this weekends challenge using javascript which should help me engrain anything that I am not fully understanding.

**What would you change/improve moving forward?**

Spend more time on one subject until it is fully understood before moving on. This week I have been moving around different areas of Javascript to see what sticks, however this isn't helpful as I need to understand the basics first.
